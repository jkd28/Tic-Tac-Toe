# Tic Tac Toe
A simple implementation of the famous game in Python.  I used this project as a means of introducing myself to Tkinter design and overall Python practices.

## Usage
`python3 tictactoe.py`  

Unfortunately, I haven't implemented a "Play Again" function yet, so in order to play multiple games, you have to run the script multiple times.  Maybe in the future I will implment this along with a win counter and other common game functions.
